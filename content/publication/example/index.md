abstract: "We introduce the Adversarial Method of Moments (AMM) for models
  defined with moment conditions. The estimator is asymptotically equivalent to
  optimally– weighted 2–step GMM, but outperforms the GMM estimator in finite
  samples. We show this both in theory and in simulations. In our theoretical
  results, we exploit the relationship between AMM and GEL estimators to show,
  using stochastic expansions, that AMM has smaller bias than optimally–weighted
  GMM. In our simulation experiments we consider 3 different models: estimation
  of the variance as in Altonji and Segal (1996), estimation of the
  autorregressive coefficient in a dynamic panel data model, and estimation of a
  DSGE model by matching IRFs. We compare the estimator’s performance to other
  commonly–used procedures in the literature, and find that AMM outperforms in
  cases where other estimators fail."
